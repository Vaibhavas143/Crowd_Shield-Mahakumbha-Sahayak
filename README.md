## üåü About The Project

Managing mega-gatherings like the Kumbh Mela presents immense logistical and safety challenges. Overcrowding, stampedes, and medical emergencies are significant risks. **Kumbha Sahayak** (meaning "Kumbh Helper") is an AI-powered solution designed to provide law enforcement and event organizers with real-time, actionable intelligence to mitigate these risks.

By leveraging computer vision on live CCTV and drone feeds, the system automates the process of crowd counting and density analysis, presenting this information on an intuitive, map-based dashboard. This allows authorities to proactively identify potential hotspots, reroute crowds, and respond to emergencies with greater speed and efficiency.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time People Counting:** Utilizes YOLOv8 to detect and count individuals from live video streams.
* **Live Density Heatmaps:** Visualizes crowd concentration on a Google Maps interface, allowing for instant identification of congested areas.
* **Predictive Alerts:** Aims to forecast potential overcrowding events before they reach critical thresholds.
* **Optimized Route Recommendations:** Calculates and suggests the safest alternate paths for crowd dispersal or emergency evacuations.
* **Centralized Emergency Protocols:** Provides a single-click interface for authorities to trigger predefined emergency responses (e.g., medical, fire).

## üíª Technology Stack

This project is a full-stack application built with a modern and scalable tech stack.

| Category | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python, Flask, Flask-RESTx, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, PyJWT, Flask-CORS |
| **Frontend** | React, Vite, React Router, Axios, Google Maps API |
| **AI Core** | Python, OpenCV, Ultralytics (YOLOv8) |
| **Database**| SQLite (Development), PostgreSQL (Production Recommended) |
| **Deployment** | Docker, Nginx (Planned) |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project is designed with a decoupled microservice-like architecture:
1.  **Frontend (React):** The user interface / dashboard that operators interact with. It communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
2.  **Backend (Flask):** The central brain of the application. It handles API requests, user authentication, business logic, and database interactions.
3.  **AI Core (Python Script):** A separate process that handles the heavy computational work of video processing and people counting. It sends its findings to the Backend API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Node.js and npm
* Git

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/kumbha-sahayak.git](https://github.com/your-username/kumbha-sahayak.git)
    cd kumbha-sahayak/backend
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    # source .venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` folder and add your configuration:
    ```env
    FLASK_CONFIG=development
    SECRET_KEY=your_super_strong_random_secret_key
    DEV_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///dev-db.sqlite
    GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
    ```
5.  **Initialize and upgrade the database:**
    ```sh
    set FLASK_APP=run.py # On Windows
    # export FLASK_APP=run.py # On macOS/Linux
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial schema"
    flask db upgrade
    ```
6.  **Create an admin user and add sample data:**
    ```sh
    flask create-admin
    flask add-sample-data
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend # From the backend directory
    ```
2.  **Install npm packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Install Google Maps and other libraries:**
    ```sh
    npm install @react-google-maps/api react-router-dom axios
    ```

### AI Core Setup

1.  **Install AI dependencies** into the backend virtual environment:
    ```sh
    # From the backend directory with .venv active
    pip install requests opencv-python ultralytics
    ```

## üö¶ Usage

To run the full application, you need to start all three services in **separate terminals**.

1.  **Terminal 1 (Backend):**
    ```sh
    # In .../backend/ with .venv active
    python run.py
    ```
2.  **Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
    ```sh
    # In .../frontend/
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Terminal 3 (AI Core):**
    ```sh
    # In .../backend/ with .venv active
    python ai_core/stream_processor.py
    ```
Access the application by navigating to the URL provided by the frontend server (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
